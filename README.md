NOT READY YET! WIP!

This is primarily a UI extension for MPV, it very slightly alters the layout of the base OSC, adds shuffle and repeat buttons, and thumbnail support based on thumbfast. Only tested on Linux and my edit of thumbfast also works only on Linux.

Dependencies: 

* Fontawesome (for shuffle and repeat icons).

Installation:
* Install the dependencies: `fontawesome`
* Put the scripts in `~/.config/mpv/scripts`
* Put the script-opts in `~/.config/mpv/script-opts`
* Open the `mpv.conf` in this repository and modify your own `~/.config/mpv/mpv.conf` to have **all** the necessary settings, and preferably the recommended ones as well.
* open the `input.conf` in this repository and add the keybinds to your own `~/.config/mpv/input.conf`
